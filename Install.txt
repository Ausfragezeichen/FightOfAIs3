IDE: I use PyCharm 2019.3

Python 3.8

Dependencies: arcade: https://arcade.academy/

Check: https://arcade.academy/venv_install/index.html
and https://arcade.academy/installation.html
[For me, this did't work. I installed python separately from PyCharm and told python in settings (ctrl + alt + s) to
use my own installation (project interpreter).
Previously, I install arcade via "pip install arcade" or "pip3 install arcade"]
Also matplotlib (and maybe numpy) is required

You can checkout the git directly in PyCharm, if installed on windows.
