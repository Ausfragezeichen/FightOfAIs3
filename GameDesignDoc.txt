version 0.1 [pre alpha]


# -------------------------------- 1. Introduction --------------------------------------
Vision: Create a 'game', where both the rules and the map can be modified easily.
Then, multiple agents (AIs) are placed in the map and they have to compete for resources, power and control over
the map. The strongest, most adaptable AI wins.
Also, to make is possible to 'test-play' the AI, a interface allows a human player to interact with the game






# -------------------------------- 2. General Ideas --------------------------------------------
The map should have a limited amount of resources, spread across such that naturally some tension is created,
as agents expand to reach newer, fresher resource fields.

The game should be turn-based and played in a isometric, hexagonal map
Each turn, the AI of each player is asked to do its move.







# -------------------------------- 3. Agents --------------------------------------------
I thought about having two sorts of 'agents'. 'NPCs', which are simple AIs which do not play to win.
They occupy the map, minding their own business and are capable of basic diplomacy. Based on their diplomatic value,
they might attack or grant favourable advantages to the player
Secondly, there are the player AIs. They play to win the map, expand to reach new resources and ultimately battle for
control over a certain region.

# 3.1 NPC - Villager
The villager is intended to have only one building (the village) which can be upgraded multiple times to reinforce its strength.
The village is placed next to a rich resource field, which the villager will defend if someone mines from it.
The villager's primary unit is the knight, which is strong in defence. To be able to have access to the resource field,
the player has to first destroy the village (and defeat the army in combat)
Thus, the motivation for a AI to attack the villager is access to the resources, however, the npc's ai should be programmed,
such that if left alone, the villager is very peaceful.
If the diplomatic value of the villager to the player is high, the bonus could be one of these:
- additional culture, or some resources per turn, or some food per turn

# 3.2 NPC - Barbaric
The barbaric is living in tents (camps) these camps can be upgraded twice to increase its defencive strength.
The barbaric is expanding twice, to a maximum amount of 3 camps which are spread not very far apart.
The barbaric AI should consider any building, which is built to close to one of its camps as an hostile act. If stressed
to much, the barbaric will attack the building, or a guarding army.
Thus, the motivation for the player ai to attack an barbaric could be, that it is short of space to build buildings and the
barbaric AI is occupying this build-space.  On the flip side, if the barbaric's diplomatic value is high, the respective
player should get a bonus:
- the barbaric helps scouting the map: the player can scout 2 or 3 tiles at once in one turn
The primary unit of the barbaric is the barbaric soldier, which is cheap and not very powerful. However in mass, the
are a serious threat and they are capable of destroying multiple buildings if provoked
